# Liquid Glass iOS course — implementation handoff

**Updated:** 2026-09-16
**Course version:** 9.11.0

## Read order

1. `USER_PREFERENCES.md`
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `CURRENT_STATE.md`
4. this handoff
5. `liquid_glass_ios_curriculum.md` only for the named lesson and its immediate neighbors in the 216-lesson plan
6. current and immediately preceding lesson HTML
7. the current iOS files under `/Users/rosen/Code/LiquidGlassLab-iOS`

Treat `CURRENT_STATE.md` as authoritative when older prose disagrees.

## Authoritative status

```yaml
total_lessons: 216
learner_confirmed_complete: 40

completed_chapters: [3, 4, 5]
chapter_9_complete: "6 of 14 (9.1–9.6 only)"

next_unresolved_checkpoint: "Lesson 1.3 — Create LiquidGlassLab"
on_ramp_returns_checkpoint_to: "Lesson 9.10 — Build a displacement field"
generated_frontier: "Lesson 9.11 — Refraction as displaced sampling"
next_planned_after_frontier: "Lesson 9.12 — Edge safety"
```

Chapters 3, 4, 5 and Lessons 9.1–9.6 stay learner-confirmed complete (graphics and math). HTML will still be updated so excerpts are Swift. Lessons 8.2–8.12 and 9.7–9.9 must be re-read on iOS. Lesson 9.10 is generated and is not complete. Lesson 9.11 is generated ahead and is not complete. Do not restore 95 of 216. Do not mark Lesson 1.3 complete just because the prior 1.3 was complete.

Chapter 7 frost stays fixed: blur `18` pt / `18` CSS px, tint amount `0.25`, saturation `0.40`. Do not rebuild blur, tint, saturation, inset-stroke math, band blur, shadow room, or the 7.10 store formula.

Do not edit CircleSdfExplorer, SoftMaskExplorer, or RoundedRectSdfExplorer math. Those explorer math contracts were confirmed excellent. Keep the same pixel arithmetic when the Swift explorers are written.

## Load-bearing section budget (2026-08-31)

Learner confirmed 9.2 and 9.3 were progressing well, then named reusable friction in later sections. Recorded in `AGENTS.md`. Apply to every later lesson:

- First sections carry the lesson. Merge known-info visualization into the intro.
- The essence section (formula + one traced value, plus lab when it is the practice) is load-bearing.
- Skip a multi-pixel comparison table that restates the lab.
- Keep a stepper only when the new operation is a sequence the lab cannot show in order (piecewise region, nearest-on-segment, multi-stage grow, two fields then min/max). If the essence section plus lab already traces the value, omit the stepper. When kept, every step must change the current operation.
- Replace **Not claimed** with **What’s next**.
- Cut negate-references, meta-lab sentences, 8.9 slot-write recaps, and vague “same arithmetic as the HTML table” lines.
- Beginner traces stay. If a cut would make the causal chain uncertain, keep the sentence.

## Chapter 8 teaching chain (8.2–8.12) — re-read on iOS

```text
8.2  .metal file → ShaderLibrary → ShaderRect (colorEffect)
8.3  8-bit / 255 → teaching half4 0..1 → return is the store
     orange half4(0.88, 0.48, 0.18, 1.0); navy half4(0.10, 0.25, 0.40, 1.0)
8.4  position.x from left; if (x < 80.0 pixels) orange else navy; y-down; convert points with displayScale
8.5  pass resolution as a Shader argument; splitX = resolution.x / 2.0
8.6  uv = position / resolution; last pixel is not exactly 1
8.7  scalar / vector / member; half 16-bit; float 32-bit
8.8  p = uv - 0.5 from the middle; × 2 puts edges near ±1; 1 = one half-width
8.9  splitU, leftColor as Shader arguments; missing argument is a Swift compile error; pass 0 to show a zero slot
8.10 trips = elapsedSeconds / 4.0; fract(uv.x - time) as red
8.11 clamp; mix = 5.4; smoothstep bends 0..1; store red 0.221875 at uv.x=0.45
8.12 Xcode Metal compile error; shrink to smallest failing program; gl_FragCoord
```

8.8 subtract is required. × 2 is the convention that makes 1 mean one half-width. The smaller stripe previews Lesson 9.9. Chapter 9 circle, center-scale, and sample offset consume `p`.

## Completed Lesson 9.1

```text
right triangle first
→ countable 3-4-5, then 0.30 / 0.40 / 0.50
→ 0.09 + 0.16 = 0.25
→ sqrt(0.25) = 0.50
→ length(p) stored as gray
```

Teaching `p = (0.30, −0.40)` on a square rectangle. Walk-around 0.70 is not the long side. × 2 unused. Sign unused.

## Completed Lesson 9.2

```text
sd = length(p) − radius
→ minus inside, zero boundary, plus outside
→ if (sd < 0.0) orange else navy
```

Default radius 0.25. Teaching pixel sd = +0.25 (outside). Center sd = −0.25 (inside). `smoothstep` unused.

## Completed Lesson 9.3

```text
mask = 1.0 − smoothstep(−band, band, sd)
→ mix(navy, orange, mask)
```

Default band 0.10. Teaching band pixel `p = (0.18, −0.24)`, `sd = +0.05`. linearFraction 0.75. curvedFraction 0.84375. mask 0.15625. stored red 0.221875. The 1 minus turns the growing-as-you-leave-the-shape smoothstep into an inside-amount.

## Completed Lesson 9.4

```text
innerHalf = outerHalf − cornerRadius
→ q = abs(p) − innerHalf
→ piecewise sdBox, then sd = sdBox − cornerRadius
→ if (sd < 0.0) orange else navy
```

Default outer half `(0.30, 0.20)` means full size `0.60 × 0.40`. Corner radius 0.10. Growing the inner sharp box by the corner radius produces Lesson 4.2’s rounded rectangle. Teaching pixel `p = (0.26, −0.18)` is the top-right inner corner plus a 3-4-5 unit direction scaled by 0.10; `sd = 0`. Visual center `C` is not a construction-circle center.

## Exercise-answer compared silhouettes (2026-09-02)

Learner could not parse two 9.5 hidden answers: the circle-vs-capsule diagnostic used a calculator length 0.2236 with no picture, and the half-width-equals-radius item named “Lesson 4.3’s circle limit” without showing the inner segment collapsing to a point. Recorded in `AGENTS.md`. Hidden answers still need labelled pictures and exact-root lengths. The diagnostic pixel is now `p = (0.15, −0.20)` so `0.15² + 0.20² = 0.25²`.

## Completed Lesson 9.5

```text
nearestX = clamp(p.x, −innerHalfW, innerHalfW)
→ sd = length(p − (nearestX, 0)) − radius
→ if (sd < 0.0) orange else navy
```

Default outer half `(0.40, 0.20)`, radius 0.20 equal to half-height. Teaching cap-boundary `p = (0.32, −0.16)` has `sd = 0`. Width slider; radius stays derived from height. Combining two complete fields with min/max is Lesson 9.6.

## Completed Lesson 9.6

```text
sdA = length(p) − radiusA
→ pB = p − B
→ sdB = length(pB) − radiusB
→ union sd = min(sdA, sdB)
→ intersection sd = max(sdA, sdB)
→ B minus A sd = max(sdB, −sdA)
→ if (sd < 0.0) orange else navy
```

Two Lesson 9.2 circles. Teaching left-only `p = (−0.10, 0)` has `sdA = length(p) − radiusA = 0.10 − 0.25 = −0.15` and `sdB = length(pB) − radiusB = 0.30 − 0.25 = +0.05`. `pB = p − B` is the same 8.8 subtract, now from B’s center. Soft mask unused.

Named-formula-before-substitution (2026-09-08, recorded in `AGENTS.md`): every teaching calculation keeps the named operations visible. Write `sdA = length(p) − radiusA = 0.10 − 0.25 = −0.15`, never `sdA = 0.10 − 0.25` or `sdA = −0.15` as the formula. Live readouts recompute that chain.

## Lesson 9.7 teaching contract — re-read on iOS

```text
uniform shader background
→ sampled = background.eval(fragCoord)
→ if (fragCoord.x < resolution.x / 2.0) sampled else orange
```

The sampled color is the half4 that `eval` returns: a copy of the input shader’s color at the read coordinate. Stripe input: `fract(uv.x * 5.0)`, `cell < 0.5` orange else navy. Teaching `uv.x = 0.15` is navy. Swift `setInputShader("background", stripeShader)`. Offset is Lesson 9.8. Geometry mask unused.

## Lesson 9.8 teaching contract — re-read on iOS

```text
readCoord = fragCoord − float2(offsetU * resolution.x, 0)
→ sampled = background.eval(readCoord)
→ return sampled
```

Default `offsetU = 0.10` is one stripe width as a fraction of the rectangle width. Teaching write `uv.x = 0.15` reads `0.05` and stores orange. The picture shifts opposite the read offset. `eval` does not wrap a negative read x. The stripe input’s `fract` still returns a color. Scale around the center is Lesson 9.9. A displacement field is Lesson 9.10. Edge safety is Lesson 9.12.

## Lesson 9.9 teaching contract — re-read on iOS

```text
p = uv − 0.5
→ readUv = p / scale + 0.5
→ sampled = background.eval(readUv × resolution)
```

No inner-half `if`. Store is four big squares: inner 2 × 2 copied onto many writes (repeat, not average). Top-left orange, top-right navy, bottom-left navy, bottom-right orange. Half of `C → (1,1)` is `(0.75, 0.75)`, still orange on that diagonal. Outer input would be painted off-picture.

## Unresolved checkpoint after the on-ramp — Lesson 9.10

```text
dir = p / length(p)
→ disp = dir × dispLen
→ readUv = uv − disp
→ sampled = background.eval(readUv × resolution)
```

The revised explanation follows the learner's exact navy input cell: x `[0.50, 0.75)`, y `[0.25, 0.50)`. W = `(0.65, 0.20)` reads approximately `(0.60528, 0.28944)` at `dispLen = 0.10`, so it stores navy. The missing y coordinate was explicitly chosen as 0.20.

**2026-09-14 rewrite.** The remaining hole was why the checker bows. Chapters 1–2 stay as the gentle on-ramp. Removed: size-as-percentage chapter, center-crossing chapter, first-entry numeric table, x = 0.65 slice, and the 0.07071 / “which sides stay straight” cards. Load-bearing section is the spoke picture on the whole line y = 0.25: same extra length, different directions, middle landing off a straight join. Neighboring cells share that line, so they share the curve. The picture frame is not the end; far from C the bow flattens. `p.x` / `p.y` split one stick into sideways and up/down legs. Hidden exercise answers are diagrams. Standing rule: `USER_PREFERENCES.md` imagination-first and `AGENTS.md` Lesson 9.10 third rewrite.

`dispLen` is an absolute distance in square-image UV units, not 10% enlargement. Straight corner joins are only approximations. The shader's guard covers `d <= 0.0001`.

Verification: `verification/lesson-09-10-review.md` and `verification/lesson-09-10-checks.json`. Check the same-cell readback, the six-step spoke construction, x/y split, whole-grid continuation, outside/flattening plots, exercise diagrams, and 1920×1080 light-mode screenshots. The HTML's shader excerpt matches the Android `DisplaceAgsl` string. The iOS explorer is `DisplacementFieldExplorer.swift` + `DisplacementField.metal`.

Lesson 9.10 remains unfinished. Live checkpoint is Lesson 1.3. Count is 40 of 216.

## Generated ahead — Lesson 9.11

```text
sd = length(p) − radius
→ falloff = 1.0 − smoothstep(−band, band, sd)
→ dir = p / d
→ disp = dir × dispLen × falloff
→ readUv = uv − disp
→ sampled = checkerBackground(readUv × resolution, resolution)
```

Teaching W = `(0.65, 0.30)`: `p = (0.15, −0.20)`, `d = 0.25`, `sd = 0`, falloff = 0.50, `disp = (0.03, −0.04)`, `readUv = (0.62, 0.34)`. Falloff is a length scale, not a color mix. Miss line x = 0.90 stays straight. iOS explorer: `RefractionSamplingExplorer.swift` + `RefractionSampling.metal`. Do not generate 9.12 unless asked.

## Future conversation

Paste `NEW_CHAT_PROMPT.md`, then in the same message name generate or questions. When the checkpoint or frontier moves, refresh section 12 of that prompt after `CURRENT_STATE.md`.

Standing delivery: no ZIP archives; new `#Preview` stacks light then dark. Details in `USER_PREFERENCES.md`.

Course progress: 40 of 216 lessons completed.
