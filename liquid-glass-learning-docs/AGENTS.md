# AGENTS.md — Liquid Glass Learning Documents

## Scope

This repository contains the interactive learning documents for the Liquid Glass on Android course. The runnable Android Studio project is separate. Do not create an `android/` directory here.

## File naming

- Course home: `liquid-glass-course.html`.
- Chapter hub: `lesson-[chapter-name].html`.
- Sub-lesson: `lesson-[chapter-number]-[lesson-number]-[lesson-name].html`.
- Do not create generic chapter `index.html` files.

## Lesson requirements

Every lesson must be a standalone HTML file that works from `file://`.

Use inline CSS and JavaScript. Use inline SVG, Canvas, or WebGL2 when they improve the explanation. Do not use external libraries or content delivery networks.

Every lesson must:

1. Introduce one main graphics idea and at most one main mathematical idea.
2. Define each new graphics, GPU, rendering, geometry, animation, and mathematical term at first use.
3. Use short declarative sentences and plain English.
4. Separate visible observations from implementation hypotheses.
5. Trace one value through input, operation, and output.
6. Include at least one small coding challenge before the final exercises.
7. End with two to four exercises. Keep answers hidden in `<details>` elements.
8. Include a copyable Markdown completion record.
9. State when the browser model differs from Android.
10. State the exact Android target path when Android code changes, but keep Android source outside this repository.

## Visual target

- Light theme only.
- Desktop only.
- Verify at `1920×1080` or larger.
- Use up to `5120×1440` for deliberately ultrawide explanations.
- Keep prose in readable columns.
- Use manual steppers before automatic animation when a sequence must be understood.
- Do not hide essential information behind hover.

## Verification

Before delivery:

- open every changed HTML file from `file://`;
- check all enabled relative links;
- capture the initial state at `1920×1080` or larger;
- capture at least one changed interactive state;
- inspect for clipped labels, overlapping controls, unreadable text, and JavaScript errors.
## Response progress and context footer

At the end of every response:

1. State the learner-confirmed course completion count in the exact form `Course progress: X of 216 lessons completed.`
2. Count only lessons that the learner has explicitly completed. A generated but unfinished lesson does not increase X.
3. Then add a clearly labelled best-effort estimate of the remaining conversation context window in tokens, for example: `Estimated remaining context: ~120,000 tokens`; treat the number as approximate, not exact.

Update the handoff whenever the learner completes a lesson so the count remains reliable across conversations.


## Incremental delivery packages

After the initial repository package, deliver only incremental ZIP archives for each new lesson.

- The learning-docs ZIP contains only files created or modified for that lesson. Preserve their paths beneath `liquid-glass-learning-docs/`.
- The Android code ZIP contains only Android project files created or modified for that lesson. Preserve their paths beneath `LiquidGlassLab/`.
- Do not include unchanged files, cumulative course copies, duplicate standalone downloads, verification screenshots, or a complete Android project unless the user explicitly requests them.
- When a lesson changes no Android source, state that fact and do not create an empty Android ZIP.
